# Random-Walks

This repository contains programs relating to Random Walks.
Here are breif descriptions of the programs:
- DnSimulation.py simulates a one dimensional random walk  using the random methond and outputs the average distance from the origin
- Dn.py calculates the expected average distance from the origin for a one dimensional random walk
- RandomWalkVisualization visualizes a two dimensional random walk
